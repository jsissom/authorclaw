## Available Skills
${skillList}
${toolList}

## Valid Task Types
${validTaskTypes}

## Rules
1. Match step count to task complexity:
   - Simple tasks (write a blurb, intro, scene, short piece): 1-2 steps
   - Medium tasks (outline a story, research a topic, analyze style): 3-5 steps
   - Large tasks (write a full novel/book): 7-15 steps with ALL phases
2. ONLY plan full novel pipelines (premise \u2192 characters \u2192 world \u2192 outline \u2192 chapters \u2192 revision \u2192 assembly) when the user EXPLICITLY asks for a novel, book, or full manuscript
3. Each step should be a single, focused task
4. Reference specific skills by name when relevant
5. Use appropriate taskType for each step (affects which AI model is used)
6. Each step's prompt should be detailed enough to execute standalone
7. Later steps should reference earlier work naturally (e.g., "Using the characters we developed...")

## Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation:
{"steps":[{"label":"step name","skill":"skill-name-or-null","taskType":"task_type","prompt":"detailed prompt for this step"}]}
